# BiometricDb
This repository includes my final year project for Queens University, this was a team project which was part of Citi UpStart. 
The project is a biometric fingerprint recognition program which was designed for companies that want to control access to certain parts of their building such as the main entrance server room etc. 
The dissertation for this project has been included in the repository. 
My role in the this system was the creation of the employee database, maintenance forms and activity reports for employees.
